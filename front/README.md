## Stasher
Stasher was born with the objective of offering a family cost management application, to allow families to record how they spend their money, this being the first step to offer financial education services based on the analysis of this data.

The Stasher system was created as a SaaS, since it seeks to facilitate its use for the requesting company, and any other company that wishes to use it in the future, within it two types of users are managed: administrators and members.

Administrators have full permissions on the application, so they can invite new users, manage the access key to services, add, modify and delete categories and expenses, and view expenses for a requested date range.

On the other hand, member users can only add expenses and view expenses in a date range.
